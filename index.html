        <h4>My Goals</h4>
<p> I practiced HTML a couple of years ago but I stopped practicing because I didn't feel
    like I had a direction or clear path to follow and pursue this area. There was too much to study
    and I didn't from where to begin. I am looking forward to become a front end web developer.
    Let the journey begin!
